                                        Tightly
                                        wrap the ball and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. </li>

                                    <li><b>Make the sauce:</b> Cook the garlic and pesto in oil, stir in the heavy

                                        and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, then whisk in the Parmesan. </li>
                                    <li><b>Assemble the ravioli:</b> Roll out the dough into sheets. Drop cheese filling
                                        onto the dough about an inch apart. Cover with the top sheet of pasta and make a
                                        seal around each portion of filling. Cut out individual ravioli, then seal the

                                    <li><b>Cook and bake the ravioli:</b> Boil the ravioli in salted water until the

                            <h2>Spaghetti</h2>
                            <div>
                                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                                <ul class="ingbox">
                                    <li><b>Spaghetti:</b> Any pasta will work. I prefer using whole wheat or whole grain
                                        because it contains fibre and nutrients. If you use regular white pasta, please
                                        note the nutritional information of this delicious spaghetti recipe will change.
                                        Gluten free spaghetti such as brown rice, or quinoa, will also work but it does
                                        cook faster than wheat. So watch it to avoid a mushy mess.</li>
                                    <li><b>Tomato sauce:</b> To make good spaghetti, you need a can of cheap, preferably
                                        low sodium, tomato sauce that reads “tomato sauce.” Not “spaghetti sauce,” not
                                        “pizza sauce,” not “pasta sauce,” not “marinara sauce.” Just “tomato sauce.”
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Parmesan cheese:</b> I highly recommend using a block of fresh Parmesan and
                                        grating your own for this simple spaghetti recipe. Pre-grated Parmesan cheese in
                                        a shaker contains cellulose as a filler and does not taste as fresh.</li>
                                    <li><b>Extra virgin olive oil and fresh garlic:</b> You’ll need lots of minced
                                        garlic in this recipe which makes it just as flavorful as a homemade spaghetti
                                        sauce.</li>
                                    <li><b>Dried oregano, salt, and pepper:</b> A simple seasoning to add to the sauce
                                        is all you need.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li><b>Cook spaghetti:</b> Fill a large Dutch oven or pot with cold water 3/4 full
                                        and bring to a boil. Add 2 tsp salt and spaghetti.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Ensure pasta does not stick together:</b> Separate pasta with tongs a few
                                        times during the first 2 minutes of cooking to ensure it does not stick.

                                        Keep cooking uncovered for 5 more minutes or until al dente, stirring
                                        occasionally.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Drain pasta:</b> Test the spaghetti for doneness towards the end by grabbing
                                        one strand onto a plate with tongs. Do not overcook until too soft. The key to
                                        tasty pasta is cooked pasta with a bite. Drain in a colander.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Cook garlic:</b> Return the pot to medium heat and add the olive oil, 4
                                        garlic cloves, and oregano. Cook for 20 seconds, stirring constantly.

                                        Garlic cooks fast and can easily burn, so don’t walk away. Turn off the heat.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Add remaining ingredients:</b> Drained pasta, tomato sauce, remaining 1/2 tsp
                                        salt, ground black pepper, and 1 more fresh garlic clove. Stir gently until
                                        warmed through.

                                        That 1 clove of fresh garlic at the end is a must!
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Sprinkle with Parmesan</b>…and serve this spaghetti with tomato sauce
                                        immediately!</li>

                                    <li><b>Start with your crust :</b> I use graham crumbs most often, but you could also use chocolate baking crumbs for a new twist! The melted butter is essential for helping it stick together when you remove it from the pan.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Beat your cream cheese :</b> room temperature is essential for no lumps! Keep in mind that full fat cream cheese is best. If you compare the packages, you can see that light cream cheese has significantly more moisture and there’s less of a chance it will set. (That being said, I use light cream cheese often and have no issues, but it’s a chance you take).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Add your powdered sugar and vanilla.</b>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Whip your cream and add it in:</b> I have always been that person who beats the cream right in with the cream cheese. If you know me at all, I’m not going to tell you you need an extra step unless you absolutely do. In this instance, I’ve tested both ways and haven’t found much of a difference at all, but whipping it separately is a little more foolproof because you can see when you’ve got stuff peaks. I have updated the recipe to reflect this change.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Chill, chill, chill.</b> And don’t even think about removing it from the pan until it’s set! We don’t want no cheesecake soup here, so plan ahead and be patient.</li>
